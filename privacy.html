    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: March 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Local Data Processing Only</h2>
    <p>
        GoSmooth2 processes all data exclusively on your iPhone.
        No data is transmitted to GoSmooth, to servers, or to third parties.
        We do not collect any personal data and have no access to anything stored on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Data Does GoSmooth2 Use?</h2>
    <p>To analyze and evaluate your driving behavior, GoSmooth2 uses the following data locally on your device:</p>

    <h3>• GPS Data (Location Data)</h3>
    <p>Used to determine speed, movement, and driving patterns.</p>

    <h3>• Motion Sensor Data</h3>
    <p>
        This includes accelerometer, gyroscope, and related motion inputs.
        These values help the AI detect and evaluate driving maneuvers.
    </p>

    <p><strong>All data remains entirely on your iPhone and is never uploaded or shared.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. How Is the Data Used?</h2>
    <p>
        All collected data is used solely to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze your driving maneuvers</li>
        <li>Evaluate your driving performance</li>
        <li>Calculate your personal driving score</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All processing is performed locally by the GoSmooth AI on your device.</p>

    <h2>4. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Driving events, raw sensor readings, and your score are stored only on your iPhone.
        Nothing is transferred outside the device.
        If you delete the app, all data is permanently removed.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No User Accounts, No Tracking, No Analytics</h2>
    <p>GoSmooth2 does not use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accounts or login systems</li>
        <li>Cloud services</li>
        <li>Tracking frameworks</li>
        <li>Analytics tools</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>Cookies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Device Permissions</h2>

    <h3>• Location Access (While Using the App)</h3>
    <p>Required for GPS-based speed and movement analysis.</p>

    <h3>• Motion & Fitness Access</h3>
    <p>Required for analyzing acceleration, braking, and steering maneuvers.</p>

    <p>The app cannot function properly without these permissions.  
       However, the data remains fully local on your device.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights (GDPR / DSGVO)</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect or store personal data, your GDPR rights technically apply,
        but there is no external data held by us to act upon.
    </p>
