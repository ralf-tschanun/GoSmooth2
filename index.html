    <h2>Welcome to GoSmooth2</h2>

    <p><strong>Are you a good driver?</strong><br>
    Of course you are! But let’s find out together.</p>

    <p>
    Let GoSmooth use your iPhone to measure how good you really are.<br>
    The GPS data and motion sensors of your iPhone are continuously analyzed by the GoSmooth AI.
    Every maneuver is evaluated, and a total score is calculated — giving you a neutral,
    objective assessment of your driving performance.
    </p>

    <p><strong>75% of all drivers consider themselves above average.</strong><br>
    With GoSmooth, you can find out whether you are truly a good driver — or maybe even a better one.</p>

    <p>
